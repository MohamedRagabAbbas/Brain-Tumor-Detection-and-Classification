## Overview

This project focuses on the detection and classification of brain tumors using MRI images. The deep learning model is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically using the VGG19 architecture. The project includes various stages such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps involve the following:
- Image augmentation for data balancing
- Cropping images to focus on the region of interest
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset
- Splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets
- Preparing data generators for model training

## Model Training

The model training process includes:
- Loading the pre-trained VGG19 model
- Adding custom classification layers
- Compiling the model with appropriate optimizer and loss function
- Training the model with early stopping and model checkpoint callbacks
- Monitoring the training process with TensorBoard

## Evaluation

Evaluation of the trained models involves:
- Assessing model performance on validation and test sets
- Analyzing accuracy and loss metrics
- Comparing different model variations and fine-tuning strategies
- Visualizing evaluation results with plots

## Deployment

The trained models can be deployed for real-world use cases:
- Saving model weights for future use
- Integrating models into applications for tumor detection
- Providing predictions for new MRI images

## Usage

To use the models for inference:
1. Load the trained model weights.
2. Preprocess the input image.
3. Pass the preprocessed image through the model.
4. Obtain predictions for tumor classification.
